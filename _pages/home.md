I am a master's student in Computer Science at [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://ethz.ch/en.html). I am currently interested in building intelligent and high-performance systems for emerging areas, such as artificial intelligence and edge computing.

Before joining ETHz, I obtained my bachelor's degree from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), where I conducted research on Machine Learning Acceleration with Prof. [Jingwen Leng](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~leng-jw/index.html).
